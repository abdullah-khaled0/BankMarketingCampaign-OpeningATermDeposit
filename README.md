## Marketing Introduction

The process by which companies create value for customers and build strong customer relationships, leading to capturing value from customers in return is essential for successful business strategies. According to Kotler and Armstrong (2010), marketing campaigns are characterized by focusing on customer needs and their overall satisfaction.

Nevertheless, there are different variables that determine whether a marketing campaign will be successful or not. These are some of the key variables to consider when crafting a marketing campaign.

## The 4 Ps of Marketing

### 1) Segment of the Population:
The first step is to identify the target audience. Which segment of the population is the marketing campaign going to address and why? This aspect is crucial since it helps determine which part of the population is most likely to respond to the campaign.

### 2) Distribution Channel to Reach the Customer's Place:
Selecting the most effective strategy to maximize the impact of the marketing campaign is key. What segment of the population should we address, and which instruments should we use to deliver our message? (e.g., Telephones, Radio, TV, Social Media, etc.)

### 3) Price:
Although pricing is usually a major factor in marketing, in this bankâ€™s case, it's not as critical because the primary objective is to encourage potential clients to open deposit accounts rather than make direct sales. The focus is on relationship building and long-term engagement.

### 4) Promotional Strategy:
The final component involves designing the strategy and how potential clients will be approached. This step should be informed by an in-depth analysis of previous campaigns (if available) to learn from past mistakes and improve effectiveness.

## Dataset Goals

- **Target Audience Analysis**: Identify which segments of the population are more likely to open deposit accounts.
- **Channel Efficiency**: Study which communication channels yield the highest conversion rates for the bankâ€™s marketing efforts.
- **Campaign Insights**: Evaluate promotional strategies and measure success through past marketing campaigns.
